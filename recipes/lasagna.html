    </p>
    <h2>Lasagna Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      The All recipes community adores this lasagna recipe because it's
      incredibly customizable, so you can easily alter the ingredient list to
      suit your needs. If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though,
      these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Meat:</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian
        sausage and lean ground beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are
        cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tomato products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes,
        two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle
        sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored
        with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel
        seeds, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna
        noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make
        this lasagna extra decadent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Egg: </strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze
        out of the lasagna when you cut into it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Make Lasagna Step-By-Step</h2>
    <p>
      Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade
      lasagna:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Make the meat sauce.</li>
      <li>Cook the noodles.</li>
      <li>Make the ricotta mixture.</li>
      <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.</li>
      <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li>
      <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How to Layer Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      The detailed layering instructions can be found in the recipe below, but
      this is the order you'll follow:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Meat sauce</li>
      <li>Noodles</li>
      <li>Ricotta mixture</li>
      <li>Mozzarella slices</li>
      <li>Meat sauce</li>
      <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Repeat the layers, then top with the remaining Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How Long to Cook Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
      The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven
      preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes,
      then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important
      to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before
      you cut into it.
